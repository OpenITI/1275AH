90#VERS#COMMENT##: The version I used for collation is a reprint. 2- I
    checked all the numbers of the names by Peter’s script. There are a lot
    of problems in these numbers; however, all cases are problems in the
    PDF, not the digital version. 3- The second volume didn’t have numbers
    for the names. I added them manually. 4- PageV02P130 was duplicated. I
    deleted it. 5- There is an appendix at the end of the book which is
    written by a different author. It exists as a separate file under the
    name of the author on the corpus:
    1381MuhammadSancani.MulhaqBadr.Shamela0006672-ara1. 6- Another edition
    of the text is accessible here:
